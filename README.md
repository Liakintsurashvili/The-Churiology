# The Churiology Website

The Churiology is designed to be a responsive website allowing visitors to view it on a range of devices. The site is targeted toward wine enthusiasts who are looking for more in-depth information on Georgian wine regions. Along with wine origins, The Churiology focuses solely on the Imereti region, providing ample information on thousands of years old unique western Georgian winemaking methods, local grape varieties and must-visit wineries.

## Design

### Color Scheme
![Image of color palette from Coolors.co](documentation/color-palete.png)

This website uses a palette of creame colors to create a simple, aesthetically pleasing palette. The palette was generated by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to source the font styles used throughout the website:

* Cinzel: Used for logo and headings
* Noto Serif: Used for the main page sections
* Dancing Script: Used for span paragraphs

### Imagery

Images found on the Homepage, Grape Varieties page, Wineries page and Form page were stock photos downloaded from [Shutterstock](https://https://www.shutterstock.com//). They were chosen to be relevant to the content of the webpage.

Icons used in the footer were imported through [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
A custom-made favicon was also created through **Font Awesome**

### Wireframes

## Features

### Existing Features

The Churiology has four main pages accessible to the user: the homepage, Grape Variety page, Wineries page and Join Us page. There is also a Response page which only shows on submission of the sign-up form.


**All pages include the following features**:

- **Header with logo and tagline**: The logo appears at the top of each page followed by a tagline underneath. When the user scrolls down the page they do not remain fixed to ensure the maximum amount of screen space is utilized by content.


- **Navigation**: The navigation menu is presented as a hamburger at the top left corner of the page on mobile devices while fitting just underneath the tagline for larger screens.

![NavBar Tablet](documentation/navbartablet.png)

Navigation allows users to easily move through the different pages of the website. Although Sticky positioning has not been used since it did not look optimal from a design point of view, the Quick Links section has been added to the footer instead to ensure a good user experience across all devices.


- **Footer**: The footer contains three sections.

 ***Social Media*** section including universally recognized icons for social media; Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

 ***Quick Links*** section with navigation links to all four pages.

 ***Contact Us*** section with email for the website.
