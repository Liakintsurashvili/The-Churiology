# The Churiology Website

The Churiology is designed to be a responsive website allowing visitors to view it on a range of devices. The site is targeted toward wine enthusiasts who are looking for more in-depth information on Georgian wine regions. Along with wine origins, The Churiology focuses solely on the Imereti region, providing ample information on thousands of years old unique western Georgian winemaking methods, local grape varieties and must-visit wineries.
