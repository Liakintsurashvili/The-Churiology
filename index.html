        <h2>Georgia, The Cradle of Wine</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="intro">Georgia boasts more than 8,000 vintages and some of the world’s most fascinating winemaking traditions.Natural wines, amber wines, amphorae, fruit-forward reds,terroir-driven wines, indigenous grape varieties – Georgia seems to have it all.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Georgia is considered by many to be the birthplace of wine, and its history can be traced back over 8000 years when the people of the South Caucasus discovered that if wild grape juice was buried in a pit over winter, it turned into wine. This led to Georgians cultivating grapes and burying clay vessels, or kvevris, to create wine - sometimes for as long as 50 years for a true vintage. In 2015, scientists studying the history of agriculture uncovered kvevris, or churis as they are refered to in western Georgia,in a huge variety of shapes, sizes and styles, often with a highly skilled level of craftmanship, highlighting how much wine was revered by ancient Georgians. Researchers analyzing the residue contained within the vessels—the remains of grapes and grape seeds—dated the material to 6000 BCE. This establishes ancient Georgia as the first known location of grape winemaking.Georgian winemaking practices existed 3,000 years before the invention of writing and 5,000 years before the start of the Iron Age.

          <h3> THE Unique Georgian Winemaking Method</h3>
          <p>
            The Churi is Georgia’s most important and best-known winemaking vessel, and it remains the centerpiece of traditional winemaking in Georgia. Though researchers believe the earliest churi were stored above ground, Georgian winemakers for millennia have buried their churi, with only the vessel’s rim visible above the ground. In order to make wine, Churies are filled with the pressed grape juice, skins, seeds and sometimes even parts of the stems.Afterwards, all of this is left to ferment for months.
            The tradition of making wine in Churi is so embedded in Georgian culture that in 2013 UNESCO added it to its catalog of humanity’s intangible cultural heritage. This marked the Churi a symbol of the deep cultural roots of Georgian wine and the authenticity of Georgian winemaking.

          <h3>Georgian Orange Wine</h3>
          <p>
            The white grapes fermented in Churi gives us the most fascinating results. Because of the prolonged contact with the grape skin, the wine becomes amber in colour and gains body and tannins. At the same time, the aromas are shifted to another level. For example, orange peel, mandarin, walnuts, dried fruit, honey, herbs and tea leaves are some of the flavours of the qvevri-made amber wines.However this sis not your usual white. Some people might find orange wines too intense.
