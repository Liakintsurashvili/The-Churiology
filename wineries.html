      <h2>The Tradition of Hospitality</h2>

      <!--wineries section-->
      <div class="wineries">
        <p>
          The traditions of hospitality in Georgia are already quite well known, but have you heard that they are quite
          different in each region of the country? In the Imereti wine region, you truly feel what it means when
          Georgians say - "the guest is sent by God". As soon as you set foot at the gate, you will find yourself under
          very special care, where the host will do everything to make you happy. You should also be warned not to
          accidentally agree to accept anything at the first offer. There is such a tradition in the Imereti wine
          region, the host offers the same things several times, be it a dish or wine, and it is desirable for the guest
          to agree only after the second or third offer. In western Georgia, and most of all, in the Imereti,
          overbearing hospitality for a guest is an expression of respect and it often feels like when you visit a
          grandparent's house where they go above and beyond to make you happy.If you want to get to know any wine
          region better, then only tasting the local wines will not be enough. Wine is often just the result of the
          lifestyle and cultural practices that characterize that place. And no matter how unbelievable it may sound,
          the wine develops the same characteristics as the people who make it.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="intro">
            To truly experience Imeretian hospitality with authentic wine selections, we at the Churiology made a list
            of wineries you simply must visit while exploaring the region.

          <h3>Otias Ezo</h3>
          <p>
            Otias Ezo is a Georgian family winery that is located in the heart of the Imereti wine region of Georgia.
            The
            name of this family establishment directly translates to Otia’s Yard. The farm and winery were given this
            name
            after legendary Georgian writer Otia Ioseliani. Otia was not only a writer but also had a great knowledge of
            and commitment to agriculture. At the estate, there is also a museum dedicated to him and his legacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, the Otias Ezo Family winery is run by the grandson of Otia.A range of excellent and high-quality
            Georgian wines are produced under the Otias Ezo Family label. These wines are made using a combination of
            traditional Georgian wine-making practices and modern technological innovations. The grapes are all grown
            and
            the wines are produced on the property in tribute to the great writer.When visiting the Otias Ezo Family
            farm
            is it not only about the wine but the entire experience. At the farm, guests can spend time exploring the
            eccentric home of Otia Loseliani and wander through the gallery where there are copies of his books
            translated
            into over 70 languages.

          <h3>Baia's Wine</h3>
          <p>
            Baia and her two younger siblings were born and raised in Obcha in a friendly, traditional family of
            winemakers. They grew up watching their preceding two generations involved in the diverse winemaking
            processes. At that time, the Abuladze family traditionally produced wine using Imeretian technology — the
            maceration process (soaking the juice of the grape with the skins and sometimes also the stems) was shorter
            and only 5-10% of grape skin was used during fermentation in Qvevri. Baia after finishing her degree in
            agronomics returned to Obcha where she has been actively promoting the wines of Imereti and growing her
            family
            winery.
          </p>
          <p>In 2015, they rebranded themselves and the label Baia’s Wine was born.With her younger siblings she
            remodeled
            the entire production structure and focused the winery’s resources on organic winemaking techniques. The
            family’s attitude towards each step of winemaking changed and a new chapter began for the winery. They
            studied
            each of their varieties and their terrior. Their first organic wine a white dry was bottled in 2015. Soon
            afterwards, the women-empowered family business became one of the first organic wine producers in region.

          <h3>David Leladze's Family Winery</h3>
          <p>
            The family winery of David Leladze is one of the oldest winery in Imereti that has been in business for over
            a
            century now. David’s great grandfather had embarked on the journey of winemaking in 1900 and ever since it
            has
            been handed down to the family from fathers to sons. David is the 4th generation of the wine maker in the
            family who has continued his ancestors’ business. He and his family have been directly looking after the
            vineyards and the cellars where wines are made with the ancient traditions of wine making.</p>
          <p>
            Located in the Imereti wine region, the terroirs of this winery is blessed with the fertile soil and
            supportive climate for the organic and healthy growth of the grapes. David makes sure to organically grow
            his
            vines using only bio-preparations and avoid any harmful chemical fertilizers. In the cellar, the winemaker
            still uses the pitchers and hazelnut wood press from 1900 to make the wines. The David Leladze is a small
            but
            humble winery that priorities quality over quantity. They produce only 5000 bottles of wines in a year.
            Recently, their Aladasturi Rose Dry Wine received a silver medal in the International Rose Championship
            2021.
            The wines are available in the local market as well as in Europe, in particular in Germany.

          <h3>Khomlis Marani</h3>
          <p>“Khomlis Marani” was founded in 2010 as a wine company. Whose primary purpose was to produce bio organic
            Churi wines with ancient, Georgian traditional methods. The winery is located in Khomli appellation, near a
            mountain with the same name.The vines are planted on the slopes of the mystical Khvamli Mountain, due to
            which
            during spring when there is cold, frosty mornings, the cold air, being heavier than warm air, flows down the
            slopes into the valley. On those mornings, the slopes are warmer than the valley, and the tender grape buds
            are spared the cold. The vines are cared for only by hand, with minimum human intervention. Khomlis Marani’s
            vineyards are cultivated in Lechkhumi, village Okureshi, Usakhelouri cultivation micro-zone. The vines are
            grown using biological fertilizers and bio-preparations. For which they have also been awarded a certificate
            which states them as a fully organic winery.
